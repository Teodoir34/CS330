How do I approach designing software?
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    I have learned an immense amount about math modeling in a 3D space and I think my brain will be hurting for the next year but I really enjoyed learning how all of these items work together!
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
    I did my best to map out on paper the overall goal in relation to my photograph prior to making the commitment to inputing the code!
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    A much more in depth understanding of 3D spatial math and a program to visualize better would be amazing to make strides in the future!
  
How do I approach developing programs?
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    I unfortunately didn't get to try a ton of new strategies due to the sheer amount of isues I had with VS attempting to render some of my more complex objects. I actually had to pivot last minute and create a whole new scene so I could showcase that I had actualy learned and completed the work.
  How did iteration factor into your development?
    Iteration made some portions of the work easier to understand as I moved onto the next step but wokring in 3D space was a big challenegeer to this each time.
  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    To be entirely honest this term was a lot with all of the computer issues and wokr travel so I fel that I unfortunately didn't get to take away as much as I want but I am looking forward to experimenting more with this type of coding because I did enjoy it when I wasn't on a time crunch!
  
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
    The skills I have been provided allow me to apply math in an entirely different way as I work towards handling larger projects both on my work team and during my school career. I enjoy math but it casn get very dense so better understanding everything is vital!!
